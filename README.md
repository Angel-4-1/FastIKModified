## Rotator
I modified the script 'SampleRotator'. 
Now the rotation speed is defined as a public value so the user can adjust it outside the script.
Also I've changed the position of the cylinder.

## Man
I modified the script 'SampleProcedualAnimation'.
Now it takes into account two steps instead of 1 and as in the rotator, the speed of those steps is a public value outside the script.
The attraction is in another postion.
